# skate_session_tracker

This is a beginner Flutter project to teach myself how to code in Dart and build cross-platform mobile apps.
If you're a skateboarder, this app (once finished) will help you by: 
1. Allowing you to easily log your skate sessions to track progress
2. Recommending a practice/warm-up routine based on your expertise and tricks performerd in recent sessions.
3. Recommend new tricks to try next based on the tricks you've already mastered.
4. Remind you about the tricks you haven't practiced in a long time beore you get rusty.
